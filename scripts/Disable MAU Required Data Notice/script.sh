# 
# 1. Identifies all users on the Mac with a UID greater than 500
# 2. Identifies the home folder location of all users identified
#    in the previous step.
# 3. Sets the com.microsoft.autoupdate2.plist file with the following
#    key and value. This will suppress Microsoft AutoUpdate's 
#    Required Data Notice screen and stop it from appearing.
